# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN and Sequential Model with Flask App and Chart.js for Confidence Plotting

This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented through a Sequential Model to recognize handwritten digits. CNNs are a powerful class of deep neural networks particularly effective in image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.

The project utilizes the Flask framework to deploy a web application, allowing users to interact with the digit recognition system through a user-friendly interface. Users can draw digits directly on the web interface, and the system will predict the digit's value using the trained CNN model.

Additionally, the application leverages Chart.js, a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts, to visualize the confidence levels associated with each prediction. After submitting a drawn digit, users receive not only the predicted digit but also a graphical representation of the model's confidence in its prediction. This provides users with insights into the reliability of the model's predictions.
